The first one involves moving the letters nine spaces in the alphabet. The seocnd one is ascii. The third one involves 8 digits of binary that form letters

They are different values and have to loop around depending on the alphabet. Also, below 65 we need to ignore everything else.

It involves Ascii digits. The second one involves ASCII index numbers that represent the letters. |
